1. "Carrie & Lowell" — Sufjan Stevens: This album tends to lean more into folk, which is a genre that you seem to appreciate based on your love for the Chris Cornell records. It's a beautiful record that feels extremely reminiscent of Higher Truth in terms of raw emotion and lyricism.

2. "Wish You Were Here" — Pink Floyd: If you enjoy The Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here might be another great piece to your Pink Floyd collection. It's considered one of their best albums and is a wonderful experience on vinyl.

3. "Sound & Color" — Alabama Shakes: Given your interest in Chris Stapleton and Black Pumas, Alabama Shakes might be right up your alley - their soulful, rootsy music should resonate well with you. Plus, "Sound & Color" is a fantastic album to have on vinyl.

4. "Continuum" — John Mayer: Given your interest in blues-influenced music (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Chris Stapleton), this album could be a good fit. It's full of impressive guitar work and soulful lyrics that Mayer is known for, similar to the musicians in your list.

5. "Music For Installations" — Brian Eno: Seeing Marconi Union in your list, it shows a liking for ambient music. Brian Eno is one of the pioneers of the genre and this album could be a great addition if you are looking for something soothing and transformative.
